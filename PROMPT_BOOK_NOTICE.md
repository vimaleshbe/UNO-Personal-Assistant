# Prompt Book — Notice

The original project contains a private prompt book that encodes system prompts, patterns, and templates used to guide the assistant. That prompt book is proprietary and is NOT included in this repository.

If you wish to reference the prompt book in public material, include only a short, high-level description (e.g., "structured system prompts and pattern library for memory extraction") and avoid publishing the actual prompt content.

Reason: the prompt book is sensitive intellectual property used to shape assistant behavior. This repository is intentionally prompt-free to allow safe public sharing.
