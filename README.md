# PA-MOCK — Personal Assistant (Proxy Repository)

This repository is a non-code "proxy" project containing documentation, architecture diagram, and publication guidance for the Personal Assistant project. It intentionally contains no application source code or prompt-book contents — only descriptive assets you can publish publicly to prove ownership and show architecture and business context.

Contents
- `docs/` — detailed documents (MCP details, business details, framework, architecture)
- `assets/` — images and diagrams (SVG architecture diagram)
- `PROMPT_BOOK_NOTICE.md` — explains prompt-book exclusion
- `POSTING_GUIDE.md` — instructions & screenshot suggestions for LinkedIn/GitHub
- `LICENSE` — MIT license

How to use
- Edit or extend any `docs/*.md` files with your own wording.
- Add screenshots to `assets/screenshots/` before publishing on LinkedIn.
- This repo is safe to publish: it excludes code and prompt-book contents.
