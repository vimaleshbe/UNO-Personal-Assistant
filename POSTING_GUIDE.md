# Posting Guide — LinkedIn & GitHub

Use this guide to capture screenshots and compose a LinkedIn post that demonstrates authorship without exposing code or proprietary prompts.

1) Screenshots to capture
- Project README (this repo root) — shows public description and docs list.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` with the rendered architecture image (`assets/architecture.svg`).
- `docs/MCP_DETAILS.md` (high-level design only).

2) Suggested LinkedIn post structure
- Short headline: "My Personal Assistant architecture and design — proving ownership"
- One-paragraph summary of purpose and business value.
- One screenshot of the architecture (export `assets/architecture.svg` to PNG at 1600×800) and one screenshot of `README.md`.
- Call-to-action: link to this GitHub repository and invite connections to DM for collaboration or demo requests.

3) Privacy checklist
- Confirm no code or prompt text is included in screenshots.
- Remove or blur any personally identifying data in images.

4) Exporting the architecture diagram
- Open `assets/architecture.svg` in a vector-capable tool (Inkscape, VS Code + SVG preview) and export PNG at high resolution.
